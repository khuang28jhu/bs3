# BS-Seeker3 
BS-Seeker3 maps bisulfite-treated reads (bs-seq) with high accuracy and ultra-fast speed. While being 1.5 time faster than BSMAP and 10 times faster than Bismark, BS-Seeker3 can map twice as many reads than both aligners. In addition to its high-throughput performance, BS-Seeker3 offers additional downstream analysis to further investigate and visualize methylation pattern post-alignment.

# <a name="NewFeatures"></a>New Features
* BS-seeker3 now employs an improved index, conducts fast alignment with SNAP, and incorporates a highly optimized pipeline to process SNAP outputs. 
* BS-seeker3 now executes local alignment through the Unnoken Algorithm, which allows high mappability and accuracy without sacrificing too much runtime. 
* BS-seeke3 also outputs a preliminary quality control graph, a meta-gene plot, and a bisulfite unconversion rate histogram. Additional downstream methylation analysis is supported by MethGo.

### Annoucement

I am aware and fixing a file-directory problem that's preventing the code to be run in a more flexible manner. Also improving the RRBS segment and problem with matching short reads (length < 50). MS1 obgligations are making this go slowly but it's getting there.

# <a name="RunningBS-Seeker3"></a>Running BS-Seeker3
BS-Seeker3 is a 3-steps pipeline: index-building, bs-seq alignment, and methylation rate calculation. Prior to alignment, BS3 first builds a custom-index for the reference genome (the user should adjust specific index-building parameters based on the reference genome size, see below for details). During alignment, BS3 uses SNAP to map bisulfite reads, and then sorts through the non-unique and incorrectly converted mappings. After alignment, methylation rate is then calcualted at the single-base resolution.

### <a name="DownloadBS-Seeker3"></a>Download BS-Seeker3
Type the following commands in an Unix Terminal:
* To download the Mac verion:
```
Stay tuned.
```
* To download the Linux version:
```
git clone https://github.com/khuang28jhu/bs3

```

### <a name="IndexBuilding"></a>Index Buidling
Use the script **bs3-build.py** to build an index for a reference genome. 

**Usage:**
```
$ ./bs3-build -h 
Usage: ./bs3-build -h [options]

-f                   Path to the reference genome; the reference genome should be in fasta format

-s                   Seed size (default: 20), a SNAP option; SNAP uses a hashtable strucutre. 
                     It builds the index by breaking the reference genome into multiple seqeunces
                     (seed) of a set length. This option determines the length of each 
                     seqeunce (seed size), and SNAP can process seed sizes to 23. A seed size of
                     20 is recommended for bisulfite reads of 100 bp long; a longer size should be
                     used for raw reads of longer length. 
                     
-L                   (default: 4), a SNAP option specific to the Linux implementation; This option 
                     determines the byte size to store the location of each seed along the 
                     reference genome. It ranges from 4 to 8 bytes. For larger genomes, a larger 
                     location size should be used; for example, to build an index based on the human 
                     genome, a location size of 5 bytes is recommended. 
```
### <a name="Alignment"></a>Alignment
Use the script **bs3-align.py** to map the raw bisulfite reads. 

**Input:**
* BS reads file in fastq

>read2
TCTGTAGACGGGTCGAATGGGGAGTTCATAGGGGGG
```
**Usage:**
```
$ ./bs3-align -h 
Usage: ./bs3-align -h [options] 

For single end reads:

-i INFILE,           Input read file (FORMAT:  fasta, fastq). Ex: read.fa or read.fa.gz

For pair end reads:

-1 FILE,             Input read file, mate 1 (FORMAT: fasta, fastq)

-2 FILE,             Input read file, mate 2 (FORMAT: fasta, fastq)

Important General options:

-K ALIGNMENT LENGTH, Neglect alignments with length below this value

-g GENOME,           Name of the reference genome (should be the same as "-f" in bs3-build.py ) [ex.
                     chr21_hg18.fa]

-m NO_MISMATCHES,    Set the number(>=1)/percentage([0, 1)) of mismatche in a read. Ex: 8 (allow 8 
                     mismatches) or 0.08 (allow 8% mismatches) [Default: 12]
                     
-l INT,              Split the input file into smaller files based on this number. Each smaller file 
                     is processed in paralell. The result is then merged. [Default: 12800000]
                     
-o OUTFILE           The name of output file 

Relevant Aligner Options:

--snap-h             MaxHits, (default: 250 on the Mac version, 300 on Linux) a SNAP option; There 
                     are often seeds matching to multiple locations in the genomes. Sorting throught all
                     the putative hits is a time-consuming process. This option sets a threshold on the 
                     number of locations that a seed can match to. Seeds matching to locations more than 
                     this number are ignored during the alignment.
                     
Methylation Rate Statistics Display Option:

--qcf=QC_F           Supply the length of the raw bisulfite reads to plot a quality control plot. A 
                     quality control plot tabulates the average rate of mismatche at each position 
                     on a raw read.

Use the script **bs3-unconversion.py** to calculate the unconversion rate of the bisulfite reads if your data contains control reads from the lambda phage library. The lambda phage DNA is free of DNA methylation, so all cytosine of the genome should have been converted to uracil. The unconverted cytosines thus reveal the unconversionr rate.

```
$ ./bs3-unconversion -h
Usage: ./bs3-unconversion -h [options]

-f INPUT          The path to the raw bisulfite read file.

-g GENOME         The path to the genome file.

# <a name="Linkingw/MethGo"></a>MethGo

MethGo is a simple and effective tool designed to analyze data from whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). MethGo provides 5 major modules:

COV: Coverage distribution of each cytosine

MET: Both global and gene-centric cytosince methylation levels

TXN: Cytosine methylation levels at transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs)

SNP: Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling

CNV: Copy number variation calling

For a complete introduction of Methgo and to download of its dependcies, please go to here: [MethGo Tutorial] (https://methgo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Please use toMethgo.py to transition to MethGo. toMethgo.py takes in and delivers to the MethGo pipeline the .sam ouput from the [Alignment](#Alignment) stage and the .CGmap file from the [Methylation Rate Calculation](#MethylationRateCalculation) stage.
